    <div class="po"><p>Organizing speeches serves two important functions. First, organization helps improve 
         clarity of thought in a systematic way.
         Second, organization increases the likelihood that the speech will be effective
         Audiences are unlikely to understand disorganized speeches and even less likely to think 
         that disorganized speakers are reliable or credible. Speeches are organized into three main 
         parts: introduction, body, and conclusion.</p></div>
